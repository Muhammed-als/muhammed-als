                                I study civil engineering, software engineering in my second semester of my masterâ€™s degree at SDU (University of Southern Denmark). As a student in Software Engineering, I have gained a strong foundation in software development methods, data structures, algorithms, networks, computer systems as well as software testing and quality assurance. I have been able to develop my programming skills that I got from high school and at the same time I have gained experience with different programming languages and frameworks. My projects have also allowed me to become better and faster at solving problems. 
                                
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am excited at the prospect of working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and push the boundaries of what is possible. I'm also motivated by the opportunity to make a difference in people's lives by creating software that solves real-world problems. I am highly motivated to continuously learn and improve my skills so that I can keep up with the rapid developments in technology. I am confident that I can achieve my goal of becoming a successful software engineer.
